pFUnit
======

* NOTE(bja, 2014-01) The development version of pFUnit (to become
  pfunit 3.x) includes changes that break with gfortran < 4.8.3. To
  continue supporting gfortran 4.7.3, we have to use the branch
  pfunit_2.1-gfortran4.7 from the pflotran pfunit bitbucket repo

* Do NOT make changes to the contents of
  ${PFLOTRAN_DEV}/tpls/pfunit. The upstream version is maintained as a
  git repository. All pflotran specific changes should be made to the
  pflotran fork of the git repo to ensure easy
  integration of upstream changes and that any pflotran specific
  changes are not lost.

* Updating from the git repository (will be turned into a shell script
  when our needs are more clear):

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ${PFLOTRAN_DIR}/tpls
    rm -rf pfunit
    git clone https://bitbucket.org/pflotran/pfunit-pflotran-fork.git pfunit
    cd pfunit
    git checkout pfunit_2.1-gfortran4.7
    git log --pretty="%H" -1 HEAD > ../git-version-pfunit.txt
    hg addremove
    hg ci -m "update pfunit to revision XXXXX"



* To build and test pfunit manually:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd ${PFLOTRAN_DEV}/tpls/pfunit
    make distclean
    make F90=gfortran-mp-4.7 DEBUG=YES all
    ./tests/tests.x
