# pflotran-dev-root-system

This is the public respository for the root water uptake module developed by (Agee et al.) for PFLOTRAN. PFLOTRAN is an open source, state-of-the-art massively parallel subsurface flow and reactive transport code. The code is developed under a GNU LGPL license allowing for third parties to interface proprietary software with the code, however any modifications to the code itself must be documented and remain open source. 

*Note: This is a forked branch of the PFLOTRAN-dev code and is not current with the master.*
