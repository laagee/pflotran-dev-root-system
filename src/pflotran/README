Items that need to be implemented

1.  Hydrostatic boundary conditions
2.  Boundary velocities for including in cell centered velocity calcs
3.  Break through curves
4.  Checkpoints
5.  Create waypoints for each time in srcs/sink
6.  For boundary connections, sign of dist(3) will change with z axis is 
      inverted
7.  Need a data structure other than velocitybc and xxbc for storing 
      boundary condition and source/sink parameters
8.  Src/sink initialization and updates
9.  Support saturation as apposed to pressure for bcs and initial conditions
