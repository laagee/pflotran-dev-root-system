Abstract = {{Predicting and quantifying impacts of potential carbon dioxide (CO2)
   leakage into shallow aquifers that overlie geologic CO2 storage
   formations is an important part of developing reliable carbon storage
   techniques. Leakage of CO2 through fractures, faults or faulty wellbores
   can reduce groundwater pH, inducing geochemical reactions that release
   solutes into the groundwater and pose a risk of degrading groundwater
   quality. In order to help quantify this risk, predictions of metal
   concentrations are needed during geologic storage of CO2. Here, we
   present regional-scale reactive transport simulations, at relatively
   fine-scale, of CO2 leakage into shallow aquifers run on the PFLOTRAN
   platform using high-performance computing. Multiple realizations of
   heterogeneous permeability distributions were generated using standard
   geostatistical methods. Increased statistical anisotropy of the
   permeability field resulted in more lateral and vertical spreading of
   the plume of impacted water, leading to increased Pb2+ (lead)
   concentrations and lower pH at a well down gradient of the CO2 leak.
   Pb2+ concentrations were higher in simulations where calcite was the
   source of Pb2+ compared to galena. The low solubility of galena
   effectively buffered the Pb2+ concentrations as galena reached
   saturation under reducing conditions along the flow path. In all cases,
   Pb2+ concentrations remained below the maximum contaminant level set by
   the EPA. Results from this study, compared to natural variability
   observed in aquifers, suggest that bicarbonate (HCO3) concentrations may
   be a better geochemical indicator of a CO2 leak under the conditions
   simulated here. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Tracer tests performed under natural or forced gradient flow conditions
   can provide useful information for characterizing subsurface properties,
   through monitoring, modeling, and interpretation of the tracer plume
   migration in an aquifer. Nonreactive tracer experiments were conducted
   at the Hanford 300 Area, along with constant-rate injection tests and
   electromagnetic borehole flowmeter tests. A Bayesian data assimilation
   technique, the method of anchored distributions (MAD) (Rubin et al.,
   2010), was applied to assimilate the experimental tracer test data with
   the other types of data and to infer the three-dimensional heterogeneous
   structure of the hydraulic conductivity in the saturated zone of the
   Hanford formation. In this study, the Bayesian prior information on the
   underlying random hydraulic conductivity field was obtained from
   previous field characterization efforts using constant-rate injection
   and borehole flowmeter test data. The posterior distribution of the
   conductivity field was obtained by further conditioning the field on the
   temporal moments of tracer breakthrough curves at various observation
   wells. MAD was implemented with the massively parallel three-dimensional
   flow and transport code PFLOTRAN to cope with the highly transient flow
   boundary conditions at the site and to meet the computational demands of
   MAD. A synthetic study proved that the proposed method could effectively
   invert tracer test data to capture the essential spatial heterogeneity
   of the three-dimensional hydraulic conductivity field. Application of
   MAD to actual field tracer data at the Hanford 300 Area demonstrates
   that inverting for spatial heterogeneity of hydraulic conductivity under
   transient flow conditions is challenging and more work is needed.}},

Abstract = {{Evolution of a hexavalent uranium {[}U(VI)] plume at the Hanford 300
   Area bordering the Columbia River was investigated to evaluate the roles
   of labile and nonlabile forms of U(VI) on the longevity of the plume. A
   high fidelity, three-dimensional, field-scale, reactive flow and
   transport model was used to represent the system. Richards' equation
   coupled to multicomponent reactitive transport equations were solved for
   times up to 100 yr, taking into account rapid fluctuations in the
   Columbia River stage resulting in pulse releases of U(VI) into the
   river. The petascale computer code PFLOTRAN developed under a Department
   of Energy Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC-2)
   project was used in the simulations and executed on Oak Ridge National
   Laboratory's Jaguar XT5 Cray supercomputer. Labile U(VI) was represented
   in the model through surface complexation reactions and its nonlabile
   form through dissolution of metatorbernite used as a surrogate mineral.
   Initial conditions were constructed corresponding to the U(VI) plume
   already in place to avoid uncertainties associated with the lack of
   historical data for the waste stream. The cumulative U(VI) flux into the
   river was compared for cases of equilibrium and multirate sorption
   models and for no sorption, and its sensitivity on the initial plume
   configuration was investigated. The presence of nonlabile U(VI) was
   found to be essential in explaining the longevity of the U(VI) plume and
   the prolonged high U(VI) concentrations at the site exceeding the USEPA
   maximum contaminant level for U(VI).}},

Abstract = {{High-resolution, three-dimensional, reactive flow and transport
   simulations are carried out to describe the migration of hexavalent
   uranium {[}U(VI)] at the Hanford 300 Area bordering the Columbia River
   and to better understand the persistence of the uranium plume at the
   site. The computer code PFLOTRAN developed under a DOE SciDAC-2 project
   is employed in the simulations that are executed on ORNL's Cray XT4/XT5
   supercomputer Jaguar. The conceptual model used in the simulations is
   based on the recognition of three distinct phases or time periods in the
   evolution of the U(VI) plume. These correspond to (1) initial waste
   emplacement; (2) initial presence of both labile and nonlabile U(VI)
   with an evolved U(VI) plume extending from the source region to the
   river boundary, representing present-day conditions; and (3) the
   complete removal of all nonlabile U(VI) and labile U(VI) in the vadose
   zone. This work focuses primarily on modeling Phase II using equilibrium
   and multirate sorption models for labile U(VI) and a continuous source
   release of nonlabile U(VI) in the South Process Pond through dissolution
   of metatorbernite as a surrogate mineral. For this case, rapid
   fluctuations in the Columbia River stage combined with the slow release
   of nonlabile U(VI) from contaminated sediment are found to play a
   predominant role in determining the migration behavior of U(VI) with
   sorption only a second-order effect. Nevertheless, a multirate model was
   essential in explaining breakthrough curves obtained from laboratory
   column experiments using the same sediment and is demonstrated to be
   important in Phase III. The calculations demonstrate that U(VI) is
   discharged to the river at a highly fluctuating rate in a ratchet-like
   behavior as the river stage rises and falls. The high-frequency
   fluctuations must be resolved in the model to calculate the flux of
   U(VI) at the river boundary. By time averaging the instantaneous flux to
   average out noise superimposed on the river stage fluctuations, the
   cumulative U(VI) flux to the river is found to increase approximately
   linearly with time. The flow rate and U(VI) flux are highly sensitive to
   the conductance boundary condition that describes the river-sediment
   interface. By adjusting the conductance coefficient to give a better
   match to the measured piezometric head, good agreement was obtained with
   field studies for both the mean flux of water of 10(9) kg/yr and U(VI)
   of 25 kg/yr at the river-aquifer boundary for a computational domain
   encompassing the South Process Pond. Finally, it is demonstrated that,
   through global mass conservation, the U(VI) leach rate from the source
   region is related to the U(VI) flux at the river boundary.}},
