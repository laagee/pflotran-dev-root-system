cloning:
hg clone https://software.lanl.gov/pflotran/hg/pflotran

if hg commit aborts:
  hg pull
  hg merge
  hg commit
  hg push


hg merge is equivalent to:

       -> Mod1 ->
orig /           \  merge
     \           /
       -> Mod2 ->

So you'ld like to see all 4 versions of the file. Kdiff3 shows them
all, with the diffs [orig -> Mod1] and [orig -> Mod2] highlighted.

Hi Peter (cc: anyone else who might want to do this),

To install Mercurial from source in, for example, ~lichtner/apps/mercurial-0.9.2, you would do the following:

python setup.py install --home=~lichtner/apps/mercurial-0.9.2

This will create the directories

  ~lichtner/apps/mercurial-0.9.2/bin
  ~lichtner/apps/mercurial-0.9.2/lib/python

You would then add to your path:

  export PATH=~lichtner/apps/mercurial-0.9.2/bin:$PATH

And then you could get Mercurial finding the correct Python stuff by doing

  export PYTHONPATH=~lichtner/apps/mercurial-0.9.2/lib/python

You would probably want to put both of these export commands into your ~/.bashrc file.

As an alternative to changing your PYTHONPATH, you can edit

  ~lichtner/apps/mercurial-0.9.2/bin/hg

and add make it look like:

  ...
  import sys
  sys.path.insert(0,'/Users/lichtner/apps/mercurial-0.9.2/lib/python)
  from mercurial import commands
  ...

I'm not sure if the sys.path.insert() requires a full path (as I used above) or if it is OK with things like '~lichtner'.  I'd go ahead and put the full path in.

As you have noted, once 0.9.2 is installed, 'hg version' will still report 0.9.1!  To fix that, edit

  ~lichtner/apps/mercurial-0.9.2/lib/python/mercurial/__version__.py

and make the 'version' string read '0.9.2'.

Hope that wasn't too confusing.  Email if you need more help.
